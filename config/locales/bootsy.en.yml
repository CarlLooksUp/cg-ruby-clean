      question1:
        question: Who should use Cognate?
        answer_html: >
           Everyone who has a trademark that has not been federally registered with the US Patent and Trademark Office. Even people who are thinking about using a mark in the near future can register that name under an “intent to use” application.

           Everyone who is hoping to start a business, or exploring different business names should conduct a search on Cognate. We have hundreds of thousands of names that are not in the USPTO database. Anyone looking to clear a business name for local, statewide, or federal use, especially entrepreneurs and small business owners on a tight budget. 
      question2:
        question: How does Cognate business name search work?
        answer_html: >
          Searching works similarly to name registration. Create an account. Search from our hundreds of thousands of business names. 
      question3:
        question: Do I need to own common law rights in my mark to make a Cognate registration?
        answer_html: >
          No. You may register with Cognate based on your actual intent to use that name for your business, as long as you note in the registration that it is based solely on intent. However mere ideas for names are not protectable and Cognate registration is not designed for the registration of names that are not currently in use. 
      question4:
        question: How much does a Cognate registration cost?
        answer_html: >
          For a limited time you can make your Cognate registration free of charge. Your name(s) will be added to our database, notifying others of your claim to your name, helping to establish an online presence for your brand, and creating a timeline of use of your mark.

      question2:
        question: What are "common law" trademarks?
        answer_html: > 
          Common law trademarks are trademark rights your business “earns” simply by using your marks in commerce in the US. Generally, the first party to use the mark on its product or service has a superior right to use the mark for their business over any other party that has adopted that mark, or filed a trademark application at a later date. This is often called "rights of first use". 
      question3:
        question: How do I register my common law rights?
        answer_html: >
          No government registration (federal, state, county, etc.) is required to create common law rights in a trademark. That is why they are called “common law” rights. Businesses are even able to use the "TM" symbol next to common law trademarks, in order to indicate their claim to common law rights. You can make a record of your common law rights by registering your mark on Cognate.
      question4:
        question: How do I know if I've created common law rights?
        answer_html: >
          Your common law rights are created through actual use (in commerce) of your trademark. Visit our %{link} section for more information.

      question5:
        question: What does actual use mean?
        answer_html: >
          Actual use of a trademark occurs when you use your trademark in connection with your goods or services (with some caveats and conditions). For more information %{link}.

      question6:
        question: What does "in commerce" mean?
        answer_html: >
          "In commerce" means in the course of doing business. If you are using a name to do business and identify a product or service, it is considered in commerce. Simple registration of a domain name is not "use in commerce" when there is no associated and active website."
      question7:
        question: How does Cognate business name registration work?
        answer_html: >
          Easy. First create an account on Cognate. Creating an account is free and fast (just name, email address, password). Then, register your business name. You will fill out a registration form similar to those used by the United States Patent and Trademark Office and individual states for business name registration. Your business name is then entered into our database alongside hundreds of thousands of other names, including federal, state, and common law trademarks. This gives your business an increased online presence, a SEO boost, and most importantly creates a public record in a centralized, specialized database – literally for the whole world to see – that you claim ownership of trademark rights in your company name or mark.
      question8:

          Searching works similarly to name registration. Create an account. Search from our hundreds of thousands of business names.
      question9:
        question: Do I need to own common law rights in my mark to make a Cognate registration? 
        answer_html: >
          No. You may register with Cognate based on your actual intent to use that name for your business, as long as you note in the registration that it is based solely on intent. However mere ideas for names are not protectable and Cognate registration is not designed for the registration of names that are not currently in use.
      question10:
        question: How much does a Cognate registration cost?
        answer_html: >
          For a limited time you can make your Cognate registration free of charge. Your name(s) will be added to our database, notifying others of your claim to your name, helping to establish an online presence for your brand, and creating a timeline of use of your mark.
      question11:
        question: What is the difference between a business "name" and a trademark? 
        answer_html: >
          Your business name or the name of a product or service may in fact be a trademark, but not all names are trademarks. A school called "Elm Street School" is a name, but is not classified as a business and, therefore, is not a trademark. But any name that you use in commerce to identify your product or service is considered a trademark. 
      question12:
        question: Will a Cognate registration stand up against a federal registration?
        answer_html: >
          Yes, assuming your Cognate registration is an accurate reflection of your common law rights. A common law trademark can have superior rights to a federal registration in certain circumstances. If the common law mark was used first, the owner of that mark could prevent another party from federally registering a similar mark if it would create confusion about the goods or services in question. 
      question13:
        question: What area does my Cognate registration cover?
        answer_html: >
          Assuming your Cognate registration accurately reflects your common law rights, it is limited to the geographic region in which you use your mark, similar to a state trademark registration.
      question14:
        question: If I have a website, should I still use Cognate?
        answer_html: >
           Yes. Registering your business name on Cognate will improve your chances of being found in trademark searches, while putting potential infringers in on notice that you claim rights to your mark.

           Having a website helps in this regard, but you are passively hoping to be found in trademark searches, and likely won’t be found at all unless someone knows of your company or is searching for your exact mark. Take a more active approach by registering on Cognate, which puts your name into our centralized, easily accessible database alongside hundreds of thousands of other federal, state, and common law marks. Not to mention creating another online presence for your brand, giving it more authority, and boosting your SEO efforts.
      question15:
        question: Why would I need to search common law trademarks?
        answer_html: >
           1) You're attempting to register a federal trademark. The federal trademark application requires a signed declaration from the applicant that "to the best of his/her knowledge and belief no other person, firm, corporation, or association has the right to use the mark in commerce..."

           2) It could save you money. And time, and aggravation down the road. Create a unique name and/or logo that identifies your product or service so that you won’t have to change it later if another party claims rights to the mark you chose. This will cost you time, money, and any goodwill your brand had accumulated under the disputed name.

           Someone may have "common law" trademark rights simply by being the first to use a trademark in commerce, since neither federal nor state registration is required to earn common law rights. Someone with common law rights can challenge your use or registration of your trademark.
      question16:
        question: Why use Cognate over the existing alternatives?
        answer_html: >
          Registering your name on Cognate furthers your brand’s online presence and makes public your claim to your naming rights. And for the time being, both of these services are FREE.

          Starting and running a business is an enormous and costly undertaking. Don’t waste money on a more expensive service without searching and registering here first.
      question17:
        question: Where else can I search common law trademarks?
        answer_html: >
           Traditionally there have been two options for common law searching:

           1) Pay a search firm. The two biggest firms are Thomson and Corsearch. Search packages start around $250 and prices escalate quickly, especially if you want your results in less than 3 days.

           2) Hire a lawyer (or a legal website such as LegalZoom). This will also cost you hundreds of dollars. Many firms will use one of the two companies above to conduct a search, and charge you on top of the search fees.
      question18:
        question: Where can I search for federal trademarks?
        answer_html: >
          You can search for federal trademarks on the USPTO website using their %{link}.
