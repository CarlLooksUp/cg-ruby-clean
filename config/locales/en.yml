      question1:
        question: Who should use Cognate?
        answer_html: >
           Everyone who has a trademark that has not been federally registered with the US Patent and Trademark Office. Even people who are thinking about using a mark in the near future can list that name under an “intent to use” application.

           Everyone who is hoping to start a business, or exploring different business names should conduct a search on Cognate. We have hundreds of thousands of names that are not in the USPTO database.
      question2:
        question: How does Cognate business name search work?
        answer_html: >
          Searching works similarly to name registration. Create an account. Search from our hundreds of thousands of business names.
      question3:
        question: Do I need to own common law rights in my mark to make a Cognate registration?
        answer_html: >
          No. You may register with Cognate based on your actual intent to use that name for your business, as long as you note in the registration that it is based solely on intent. However mere ideas for names are not protectable and Cognate registration is not designed for the registration of names that are not currently in use.
      question4:
        question: How much does a Cognate registration cost?
        answer_html: >
          For a limited time you can make your Cognate registration free of charge. Your name(s) will be added to our database, notifying others of your claim to your name, helping to establish an online presence for your brand, and creating a timeline of use of your mark.

      question2:
        question: What are "common law" trademarks?
        answer_html: >
          Common law trademarks are trademark rights your business “earns” simply by using your marks in 
          commerce in the US. Generally, the first party to use the mark on its product or service has a 
          superior right to use the mark for their business over any other party that has adopted that mark, 
          or filed a trademark application at a later date. This is often called "rights of first use".
      question3:
        question: How do I claim my common law rights?
        answer_html: >
          No government registration (federal, state, county, etc.) is required to create common law rights 
          in a trademark. That is why they are called “common law” rights. Businesses are even able to use 
          the "TM" symbol next to common law trademarks, in order to indicate their claim to common law 
          rights. You can make a record of your common law rights by %{link} your mark on Cognate.

      question4:
        question: How do I know if I've created common law rights?
        answer_html: >
          Your common law rights are created through actual use (in commerce) of your trademark. Visit our
           %{link} section for more information.

      question5:
        question: What does actual use mean?
        answer_html: >
          Actual use of a trademark occurs when you use your trademark in connection with your goods or 
          services (with some caveats and conditions). For more information %{link}.

      question6:
        question: What does "in commerce" mean?
        answer_html: >
          "In commerce" means in the course of doing business. If you are using a name to do business and 
          identify a product or service, it is considered in commerce. Simple registration of a domain name 
          is not "use in commerce" when there is no associated and active website.
      question7:
        question: How does Cognate trademark listing work?
        answer_html: >
          <ol>
            <li><i>%{link} on Cognate.</i> Creating an account is free and fast (just name, email address, 
            password).</li> 
            <li><i>%{link_2} Your Trademark Claim.</i> You will fill out a form similar 
            to those used by the United States Patent and Trademark Office and individual states for trademark 
            registration.</li>
          </ol>
            Your mark is now entered into our database alongside over a million other marks, 
            including federal, state, and common law trademarks. Most importantly this creates a public 
            record in a centralized, specialized database that you claim ownership of trademark rights in 
            your company name or mark – literally for the whole world to see. It also gives your business an 
            increased online presence, and a SEO boost.

      question9:
        question: Do I need to own common law rights in my mark to list on Cognate?
        answer_html: >
          No. You may %{link} your mark on Cognate based on your actual intent to use that name for your 
          business, as long as you note in the registration that it is based solely on intent. However mere 
          ideas for names are not protectable and claims on Cognate are strongest when the mark is in use.

      question10:
        question: How much does a Cognate listing cost?
        answer_html: >
          Cognate listings start at $19.95 for a 4-month peroid. Check out our %{link} page for 
          more information. As soon as your listing is complete, your mark(s) will be added to our 
          database, notifying others of your claim to your name, helping to establish an online presence for 
          your brand, and creating a timeline of use of your mark.

      question11:
        question: What is the difference between a business "name" and a trademark?
        answer_html: >
          Your business name or the name of a product or service may in fact be a trademark, but not all 
          names are trademarks. A school called "Elm Street School" is a name, but is not classified as a 
          business and, therefore, is not a trademark. But any name that you use in commerce to identify 
          your product or service is considered a trademark.
      question12:
        question: Will a Cognate listing stand up against a federal registration?
        answer_html: >
          Yes, assuming your Cognate listing is an accurate reflection of your common law rights. A 
          common law trademark can have superior rights to a federal registration in certain circumstances. 
          If the common law mark was used first, the owner of that mark could prevent another party from 
          federally registering a similar mark if it would create confusion about the goods or services in 
          question.
      question13:
        question: What geographic area does my Cognate listing cover?
        answer_html: >
          Assuming your Cognate listing accurately reflects your common law rights, it is limited to the 
          geographic region in which you use your mark, similar to a state trademark registration.
      question14:
        question: If I have a website, should I still use Cognate?
        answer_html: >
           Yes. %{link} your business name on Cognate will improve your chances of being found in trademark 
           searches, while putting potential infringers on notice that you claim rights to your mark.

           Having a website helps in this regard, but you are passively hoping to be found in trademark 
           searches, and likely won’t be found at all unless someone knows of your company or is searching 
           for your exact mark. Take a more active approach by listing your mark on Cognate, which puts your 
           name into our centralized, easily accessible database alongside over a million of other federal, 
           state, and common law marks. Not to mention creating another online presence for your brand, 
           giving it more authority, and boosting your SEO efforts.

      question15:
        question: Why would I need to search common law trademarks?
        answer_html: >
          <ol>
           <li><i>You're attempting to register a federal trademark.</i> The federal trademark application 
           requires a signed declaration from the applicant that "to the best of his/her knowledge and belief 
           no other person, firm, corporation, or association has the right to use the mark in 
           commerce..."</li>

           <li><i>It could save you money.</i> And time, and aggravation down the road. Create a unique name 
           and/or logo that identifies your product or service so that you won’t have to change it later if 
           another party claims rights to the mark you chose. A conflict will cost you time, money, and any 
           goodwill your brand had accumulated under the disputed name.</li>
          </ol>
           Someone may have "common law" trademark rights simply by being the first to use a trademark in 
           commerce, since neither federal nor state registration is required to earn common law rights. 
           Someone with common law rights can challenge your use or registration of your trademark.
      question16:
        question: Why use Cognate over the existing alternatives?
        answer_html: >
          Cognate allows you to make a claim to your existing trademark rights at a fraction of the cost and 
          time of the existing alternatives. Starting and running a business is an enormous and costly 
          undertaking. Don’t waste time and money on a more expensive service without %{link} and %{link_2} 
          here first.

      question17:
        question: Where else can I search common law trademarks?
        answer_html: >
           Traditionally there have been two options for common law searching:

           <ol>
           <li><i>Pay a search firm.</i> The two biggest firms are Thomson and Corsearch. Search packages 
           start around $250 and prices escalate quickly, especially if you want your results in less than 
           3 days.</li>

           <li><i>Hire a lawyer (or a "legal" website such as LegalZoom).</i> This will also cost you 
           hundreds of dollars. Many law firms will use one of the two companies above to conduct a search, 
           and charge you on top of the search fees.</li>
           </ol>
      question18:
        question: Where can I search for federal trademarks?
        answer_html: >
          You can search for federal trademarks on the USPTO website using their %{link}.
