              <p>TRADEMARK AND COPYRIGHT: COGNATE respects trademark rights. We reserve the sole right to transfer or suspend or cancel any Accounts which use names or content that violates another party’s trademark rights, or cause or are likely to cause confusion. Should you have concerns that your mark is being infringed by another COGNATE user, please email us at <a href="mailto:info@cognate.com">info@COGNATE.COM</a> and we will take action if COGNATE, in its sole discretion believes action is appropriate. When contacting us, please include as much information as possible about the name to which you object and your own trademark rights.</p>
              <p>Where, in COGNATE’s sole discretion, it believes it to be appropriate, COGNATE will terminate or disable any User Accounts which infringe intellectual property rights of others, particularly where such infringements appear to COGNATE to be intentional.</p>
              <p>COGNATE will respond consistent with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 to infringements on COGNATE reported to our Designated Copyright Agent.  Where you provide us with a DMCA Notice of Alleged Infringement, we will then review such notice and, where appropriate, will take the required action. Be sure to identify YOUR work, and the WORK(S) which you claim are infringing.  We may then contact you and request a particular form be completed in order to make a DMCA notice, and to which we will respond.</p>
