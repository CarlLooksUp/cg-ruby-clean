Cogname is for business name clearance.

We want to make it easy to find a brand name that's safe to use, so we're developing a new way to search for existing business names.


-\>Cogname is comprehensive.

We've compiled trademark registrations from all 50 states to make it easy for anyone to find business names either on a national scale or tailored to their area of operation. In addition, Cogname allows owners of non-trademarked names to submit their names in order to stake a claim to rights of first use. In this way, we hope to create a single comprehensive repository of business names in America.


-\>Cogname is accessible.

Current solutions for business name clearance require pay-per-query searches or legal fees. We're looking to cut the lawyers out of the equation and reduce costs for entrepreneurs starting a new business or product line. Once you've come up with a great name, you can get back to running your business without having sunk loads of time and money into the search.
